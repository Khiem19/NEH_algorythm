# NEH_algorythm
It's heuristic algorithm for solving permutation flowhop scheduling problem, where the goal is to find optimal order of n jobs to be proccessed on m machines. Single machine can only proccess one job at the time. NEH find correct sequence (not the best one), by adding one job in every step and compute best place for it between other tasks added in previous steps.
